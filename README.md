# AAI-551 Project: Best Card Game

Welcome to the "Best Card" gaming project! This project is centered around object-oriented programming in Python and focuses on a card game.

## Game Rules

- The game ranks cards based on priority, with the "King of Spades" being the highest and the "Ace of Clubs" being the lowest.
- Suit hierarchy: Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs.
- Rank hierarchy: King > Queen > Jack > Ace.

## Card Values

- Spades are assigned a value of 3.
- Hearts are assigned a value of 2.
- Diamonds are assigned a value of 1.
- Clubs are assigned a value of 0.

- Ace is assigned a value of 1.
- Jack is assigned a value of 11.
- Queen is assigned a value of 12.
- King is assigned a value of 13.

These rules govern the card values and priorities in the game.

Feel free to explore this project to learn more about object-oriented programming in Python and how the "Best Card" game is implemented.
